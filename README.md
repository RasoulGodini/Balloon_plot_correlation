The scripts perform a complex correlation analysis for different subgroups of the population and their combinations, 
and then visualize the results using a balloon plot. It can be used as a template for other similar projects.

Note: The data is random.
Note: The top x-axis can be added with some modifications to the right y-axis.
Note: The legend for the color code is at the bottom.

Enjoy it.
